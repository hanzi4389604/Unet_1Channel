This is a practice for the Unet construction.
This structure is only for 1 input chennel and 1 channel output.
For medical images, it may have several input layers with RGB or multispectral images, this Unet need to be changed accordingly.
Meanwhile, the output have only 1 class for this practice, and other corresponding changes need to be made for multi-class output data.
Only the code for N.network training is uploaded. 
The evaluaation code is not finished yet, becuase time is limited.
