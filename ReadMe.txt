This is a practice for the Unet construction.

This structure is only for 1 input chennel and 1 output channel.

For medical images, it may has several input channels with RGB or multispectral channels, the channels in this Unet-Network need to be changed accordingly.

Meanwhile, the output data has only 1 class for this practice, and other corresponding changes need to be made for multi-class output data.

Only the code for N.network training is uploaded. 

The evaluation code is not finished yet, becuase time is limited.
